##TEST_SPEAKERS
###OVERVIEW:
This directory contains code for testing and recording the output of Arduino-controlled speaker systems. Use for testing the function of speaker systems, associated output pins, and connections in between.


###DESCRIPTION
This directory contains code for two programs:

* **test_speakers.ino**: A simple sketch for generating a single white noise stimulus from an Arduino-controlled speaker.

* **get_speaker_spectrogram**: A program for generating a white noise stimulus from an Arduino-controlled speaker, recording the output through a prepolarized microphone and generating a spectrogram of the output in MATLAB. 


For details, see each program's `README.md` files and header comments for each file.
